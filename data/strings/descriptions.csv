diableavionics_miniGust_j,SHIP,"While ostensibly related to the regular Gust-class hull design, it is unclear whether this model was a small scale prototype that turned out too performant to be put aside or rather was a successful miniaturization attempt. In any case the Pocket-Gust translates what made its bigger brother good as a light cruiser into an even nimbler Destroyer frame. 

This ship has been Restored from a Destroyed Ship to Near Standard Spec but was unable to restore the Remote control due to the lack of Specialized Parts, so instead they added a Plasma Jets system to it.",,,
diableavionics_gust_j,SHIP,"A mainstay of Diable Avionics, these light cruisers are fast and excel in providing field support to the Wanzer element they carry. Their primary battery consists of a front-facing heavy weapon emplacement which gives them an unexpected punch but the relative lack of secondary weapons limits their effectiveness against multiple threats.

The Gust cruiser design dates back almost 150 years before the collapse, during the peak of Diable Avionics's growth when their military contracts abounded and they could afford the R&D cost for less conventional designs. Historical notes and logs from the oldest ships of this class occasionally describe the difficulty of incorporating the proprietary ""Overlord"" system, and all the interferences to the local electromagnetic environment it causes, in a relatively small hull with its sensitive comm/data sphere. 

This device allows elite pilots well protected within the confine of the cruiser hull to remotely take over the controls of any fighter hosted by the Gust. The need for an open interface controls, the cost of the Tachyon comm-links and the limited time such connection can be upheld still prevent the massive use of remote-controlled Wanzers. 

Nonetheless, that system provides a potent tool that can be used in a pinch to deliver a decisive blow. While initially welcomed by regular pilots that saw their odds of surviving increase as well as being able to learn directly from the bests, these systems have since taken a grim reputation as they can also be used to ensure a mission get carried out at any cost.

This ship has been Restored from a Destroyed Ship to Near Standard Spec but was unable to restore the Remote control due to the lack of Specialized Parts, so instead they added a Plasma Burn system to it.",,,
diableavionics_versant_j,SHIP,"One of the very last pre-Collapse designs the local branch of the Diable Avionics Corporation got its hands on before being abruptly cut-off. It features a mobile frame that can manipulate its shape to increase raw speed, or maneuverability. Advanced integrated weaponry and the latest version of the Diable Avionics's Quantum Targeting Prediction software(TM) come pre-installed.

This Mass Production version has a Phase Core Stable Enough for Minor Stats Boost.",,,
diableavionics_vapor_j,SHIP,"A nimble ultralight frigate chassis with a heavy frontal armament. Capable of disrupting fleet operations easily despite its sub-par point defense weapon mounts. 

Junker’s Guild Restored those ships and changed their system to Flux Redirection, thanks to the Abundance of Daze Class Salvage being recovered, tho the old system made the ship a complete utter nightmare to remove but restoring it instead made the Change way easier, it also made the Maintenace Cost Lower than needed since the frame is less Stressed out.",,,
diableavionics_fractus_j,SHIP,"Taking after the ubiquitous Condor, this ship is a conversion of the Chinook tanker hull, modified to house a double flight deck. The central fuel tank has been traded for a medium-sized hard-point, useful for supporting the ship's strike-craft complement with stand-off artillery fire.

This Carrier now has Specialized Gantries for The Arbitrator series thanks to the Salvage & Engineering Team Junker’s Guild.",,,
diableavionics_rime_m_j,SHIP,"A light cruiser getting progressively phased out due to midling combat performance. While still adequate as a back-lines support ship, the fragility of the hull as well as its lack of dedicated Wanzer facilities has lead the Admiralty to decide to convert existing Rime-class into armed merchants instead.

Junker's Guild Restored those Ships and Modified them with their Favorite System, Plasma Jets.",,,
